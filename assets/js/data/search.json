You can download the files required for this tutorial from here: WordStar 3.3 package for Altair Z80s CP/M-80 2.2Installing WordStar 3.3First, you need to install CP/M-80 2.2 using Altair Z80 emulator. If have not already done so, see our tutorial on how to experience CP/M-80 2.2. After you have installed CP/M-80 2.2, unzip the WordStar 3.3 package you downloaded from above. There are two files in that archive: ws33 ws33.dskCopy those two files to the folder where you stored the files for CP/M-80 2.2. Now you can open a terminal/Command Prompt and enter the following command to start CP/M-80 2.2 with WordStar 3.3 diskette loaded:$ ./altairz80l64 ws33Now type b: and press enter to switch to B drive. Enter the following command to start WordStar 3.3:B&gt; wsYou can press X to exit WordStar. Read the mannuals linked below to learn how to use WordStar.We will now create shell/Batch scripts to start CP/M-80 2.2 with WordStar 3.3 diskette loaded in B drive.On LinuxCreate a file called ws33.sh in the folder where you stored everything related to the VM with the following contents:#!/bin/bash./altairz80l64 ws33Save and close the file and make it executable by using this command:$ chmod +x ./ws33.shYou need to execute the above command in the folder where you created that script. Now you can right click on that file and click on Run as Program to open the emulator. Some DEs and distros may have other methods of running shell scripts.On WindowsOn windows create a file called ws33.bat in the folder where the emulator files are located with the following contents:altairz80l64.exe ws33Save and close that file. Now you can double click the file to open the emulator with the WordStar 3.3 diskette loaded.That’s it.

You can download the files needed for this tutorial here: YAZE sources for Linux YAZE binaries for WindowsInstalling YAZELinuxOn Linux, you need to build YAZE from sources. Extract the source archive and delete the Makefile. Rename the Makefile_linux_your_architecture file to Makefile. For example, I renamed Makefile_linux_64_intel_nocona to Makefile because I am on an Intel cpu. Then open a terminal and navigate to that folder. Run the following commands:$ make$ sudo make installEnter your password when asked. This will install YAZE on your system.You can now run yaze to start YAZE. Press any key when asked to do so. Read the imformation presented on your screen before pressing any key.You will now get to the A: prompt. You can run the DIR command to see a list of files.That’s it for Linux. We have installed and used YAZE with CP/M-80 2.2.WindowsOn Windows, double click the installer file to start installation of YAZE.Then click on Extract. It will install YAZE.

There are three system on which we can run CP/M-80 2.2: KAYPRO II NCR Decision Mate V Sharp X1In this tutorial, we are going to use the NCR Decision Mate V emulation.

For windows, see our tutorial on Legacy Installer on how to install MAME on Windows. For linux, you can install mame from the official repository of your distribution. See this page for a list of distributions offering the package. If your distribution does not include mame in its repositories (highly unlikely), you can build MAME from source.After you have installed MAME, you need to create a folder in which all the files related to the emulator will reside. Open a Terminal/Command Prompt window and move to that folder. Then run:$ mame -ccYou may need to specify the path to MAME if you are on Windows:&gt; \"C:\\Program Files\\MAME\\mame.exe\" -ccThis command will create some basic config files for MAME in that folder. Now open the folder in your File Manager and delete the mame.ini file. Extract the mame.ini file from the archive you downloaded above according to your platform and copy it to the folder in which you are storing all the files related to the emulator. Create a folder called roms in that folder. Copy the ROMs archives to that folder. Do not extract the ROMs from the zip files. Move the zip files without extracting to the roms folder.Extract the disk image archive and copy the Cpm80dmv.imd file and the extras folder to that folder where you are storing all the files related to the emulator.Now switch back to the terminal and run:$ mame dmvYou need to prefix mame with the path on Windows as shown above. The MAME window should open like this:If the window does not open and you get a ROM not found or similar error, see the troubleshooting section below. Press any key to continue.Press the CAPS LOCK key to enable UI control. Then press the TAB key to open the menu.Then click on File Manager &gt; floppydisk1. Choose the Cpm80dmv.imd file from the list and choose Read-write.Then click on Return to Previous menu &gt; Return to the machine. Press the CAPS LOCK key once again to turn off UI control. Press enter a few times to start CP/M-80 2.2. You can enter the DIR command to see a list of files.Now, you can close this window. The next time you open the emulator again, you don’t need to go through all these steps. Just open your terminal and navigate to the folder where all the the files related to the emulator are stored and run:$ mame dmvYou need to prefix the above command with the path to MAME on windows as shown above.But this method is very troublesome and lengthy. We can make a shell script which runs the above command on linux:#!/bin/bashmame dmvand save the file as CPM-80-dmv.sh. Then make the script executable by running the following command in terminal after navigating to that folder:$ sudo chmod +x ./CPM-80-dmv.shThen we can right click on that file and click on Run as Program to open the emulator. Some DEs and distros may have other methods of running shell scripts.On Windows, it is much easier. Create a file called CPM-80-dmv.bat in that folder with the following contents:\"C:\\Program Files\\MAME\\mame.exe\" dmvThen double click on that file to launch the emulator.That’s it. We have installed and run CP/M-80 2.2 using the MAME’s NCR Decision Mate V emulation. There are disk images for some software in the extra folder. We will cover these software later.TroubleshootingFirst make sure that you have placed the roms files in the correct place. Do not extract the files. Place the zip files directly in the roms folder.On Linux, there might be another error. MAME might have been configured to look in your ~/.mame folder for its config files. If that is the case, running the command mame without any parameters in the folder where you have stored the files would result in MAME opening in full screen instead of a window. If you are affected by this problem, here is the solution: Configure your file manager to show hidden files. Go to the ~/.mame folder. Delete the mame.ini file there. Copy the mame.ini file you downloaded from above to that folder.The mame.ini file you downloaded above instructs MAME to look for another mame.ini file in the current folder and use it if found. So, you can then follow the tutorial and everything will work.Some explanationI asked you to replace the mame.ini file with the one you downloaded from here. What are the differences between those files? Here are they: It instructs MAME to open in windowed mode instead of full screen. It modifies the key needed for enabling UI controls from Scroll Lock to Caps Lock. This is done because many keyboards do not have a Scroll Lock key.
