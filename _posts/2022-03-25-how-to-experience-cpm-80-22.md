In the last post, we saw [how to experience CP/M-80 1.4]({% post_url 2022-03-24-how-to-experience-cpm-80-14 %}){:target="_blank"}. For that and 86-DOS, we used a special emulator. For CP/M-80 2.2, there are 3 options. In this tutorial we are going to use the same emulator we used for the previous tutorials. You can download the emulator package from here:

- [CP/M-80 2.2 for Linux](https://archive.org/download/cpm-80-v2.2-linux/CPM80v2.2onlinux.tar.xz)
- [CP/M-80 2.2 for Windows](https://archive.org/download/cpm-80-v2.2-windows/CPM80v2.2onwindows.zip)

## Using CP/M-80 2.2

It is very easy to start using CP/M-80 2.2. On Linux, extract the above archive and right click on the cpm2.sh file and choose "Run as a Program" or run the shell file the way you run any other shell file. On Windows, extract the above archive and double click the Runme.bat file. The Virtual Machine will start.

You can enter the DIR command to see a list of files.

That's it! We used CP/M-80 2.2, an operating system launched in 1982 after 40 years (at the time of writing this tutorial).
