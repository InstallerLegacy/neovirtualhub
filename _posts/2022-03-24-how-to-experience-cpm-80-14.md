In the last post, we saw [how to experience 86-DOS]({% post_url 2022-03-23-how-to-experience-86-dos %}){:target="_blank"}. 86-DOS was a clone of CP/M. In this tutorial, we are going to use CP/M 1.4. Like 86-DOS, it also requires a special emulator which can be downloaded from here:

- [CP/M-80 1.4 for Linux](/assets/Downloads/CPM/CPM-80/1.4/CPM80v1.4onlinux.tar.xz)
- [CP/M-80 1.4 for Windows](/assets/Downloads/CPM/CPM-80/1.4/CPM80v1.4onwindows.zip)

## Using CP/M-80 1.4

It is very easy to start using CP/M-80 1.4. On Linux, extract the above archive and right click on the cpm1.sh file and choose `Run as a Program` or run the shell file the way you run any other shell file. On Windows, extract the above archive and double click the Runme.bat file. The Virtual Machine will start.

You can enter the DIR command to see a list of files.

That's it! We used CP/M-80 1.4, an operating system launched in 1982 after 40 years (at the time of writing this tutorial).
